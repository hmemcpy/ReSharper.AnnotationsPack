Annotations Pack for ReSharper
===

## What is this?
ReSharper largely relies on heuristics to perform code analysis, detect issues and offer suggestions. However, heuristics cannot detect everything, therefore ReSharper uses [Code Annotations](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Code_Analysis__Code_Annotations.html) to better understand the code it has to work with. Annotations can be applied as attributes in code, or [externally via XML](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Code_Analysis__External_Annotations.html) files.

For an overview of Annotations, you can watch a webinar I recorded with JetBrains called [ReSharper Secrets](http://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2014/02/18/webinar-recording-and-qa-resharper-secrets-with-igal-tabachnik/), which describes annotations and their use.

This project is a collection of external XML annotations for various (open-source) frameworks and libraries that provide ReSharper with better support for those libraries. For a complete list of supported libraries, please check the [wiki](wiki).
